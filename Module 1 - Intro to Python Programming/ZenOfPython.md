Beautiful is better than ugly.
Writing clean, well-organized code is better than writing messy and convoluted code.

Explicit is better than implicit.
It's better to be explicit in code, even if it seems verbose, as it makes the code more readable and understandable.

Simple is better than complex.
Prefer straightforward and easy-to-understand solutions rather than complex and convoluted ones.

Complex is better than complicated.
If a problem genuinely requires complexity, it's better to have a well-structured and comprehensible complex solution than a complicated and confusing one.

Flat is better than nested.
Avoid excessive nested loops or conditional statements. Prefer a flatter structure to improve readability.

Sparse is better than dense.
Opt for code with enough whitespace and separation between elements to improve clarity, rather than cramming everything together.

Readability counts.
Write code that is easy for others (and yourself) to read and understand, as code is read more often than it is written.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Try to adhere to common coding practices and conventions, even in cases that might seem unique or special.

Although practicality beats purity.
Sometimes, it's better to use a pragmatic solution that works effectively rather than striving for an overly pure but less practical approach.

Errors should never pass silently.
Make sure that errors and exceptions are properly handled and reported, not ignored silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.
It's acceptable to catch and handle specific exceptions if you can handle them gracefully.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Avoid making assumptions about input data or behavior if it's not explicitly defined. Instead, be explicit in handling ambiguity.

There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
Python prefers a single, clear, and straightforward way to accomplish a task rather than multiple obscure approaches.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, is Dutch, so some design choices may reflect his perspective.

Now is better than never.
It's better to start coding and making progress now rather than waiting for the perfect moment or overthinking.

Although never is often better than right now.
It's sometimes better to take a step back, plan, and understand the problem before rushing into a solution.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
Strive for clear and straightforward code that doesn't require lengthy explanations or justifications.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Code that is simple, clear, and easy to explain is often a good sign of a well-designed solution.

Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!
Proper use of namespaces helps keep code organized and reduces naming conflicts. Embrace this concept in designing software.
