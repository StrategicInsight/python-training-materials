    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, rather than compiled language. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who've only worked in one or another, compiled languages like Java, C# and Rust compile to a lower-level machine code or bytecode. They do all of their type checking during the compilation process, and the end result usually runs very efficiently and performantly when executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages like JavaScript, Python, and PHP do not get compiled down to a lower-level language. They are run immediately by the interpreter. That means that they can experience a lot of runtime errors, and that they aren't very fast. So why would we want that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief: because _machine time is much cheaper than developer time_. Interpreted languages allow us to iterate rapidly. We spend less time compiling, more time building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, in particular, excels at being simple to read and understand, which is the single biggest factor in making the time we spend as developers more effective. You spend more time reading code than writing code, and the easier that code is to read, the better your life will be. This is neatly encapsulated in the concept embraced by the Python community of writing code that is 'pythonic,' by which we mean code that is natural to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's even a poem about it... built into the standard library of the language."
